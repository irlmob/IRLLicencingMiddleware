 A struct that provides details for a copyright notice.

 Use this struct to create a ``LicencingMiddleware`` instance with a copyright notice. The copyright notice will be printed out to the console when ``LicencingMiddleware/setup(in:ignoredPathroot:)`` is called on the ``LicencingMiddleware`` instance.
 
 ## Example
 ```swift
 let copyright =  LicencingMiddleware(year: "2023",
                                      copyright: "Company Inc. Headquarter on the moon",
                                      copyrighter: "Company Inc.",
                                      projectName: "Example Project",
                                      subProjectName: "Frontend App",
                                      version: "v1.0.0")
 print(copyright.notice)
 ```
