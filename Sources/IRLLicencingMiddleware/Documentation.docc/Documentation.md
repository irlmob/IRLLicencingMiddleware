# ``IRLLicencingMiddleware``

ðŸ›ƒ Protect your `Vapor application` with a `Middleware` Licencing mechanisms.

## Overview

Use this struct to set up license [Middleware](https://docs.vapor.codes/advanced/middleware/) in a [Vapor application](https://www.vapor.codes). Call the ``LicencingMiddleware/setup(in:ignoredPathroot:)`` method to add the middleware to the application.

- Note: A ``LicencingMiddleware`` instance can also include a ``LicencingCopyrightNotice`` instance, which will be printed out to the console when ``LicencingMiddleware/setup(in:ignoredPathroot:)`` is called.

- Warning: You should perform this setup as the very first step during your application configuration to protect the usage of the application. It will then validate every `Request` to the application against a valid licence.


## Dependencies
- [IRLLicencing](https://github.com/irlmob/IRLLicencing) (iRLMobile) - Licence validation mechanism.
- [Leaf Error Middleware](https://github.com/brokenhandsio/leaf-error-middleware) (0xTim) -  Custom 404 and server error pages. 

## Getting Started

Getting started with ``IRLLicencingMiddleware`` is easy. Simply add the code to your project, distribute your Framework or Application as a closed source, and lock your code to be usable only with a valid license and email. Once your client verifies the license, your code will be able to run with confidence, knowing that it is fully licensed and secure.

IRLLicencing primarily uses [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) as its build tool, so we recommend using that as well. If you want to depend on IRLLicencing in your own project, it's as simple as adding a `dependencies` clause to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/irlmob/IRLLicencingMiddleware.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

#### Swift 5.7 and newer (swift-tools-version:5.7)
```swift
    dependencies: [ "IRLLicencingMiddleware" ]
```

### Using Xcode Package support

If your project is set up as an Xcode project and you're using Xcode 11+, you can add ``IRLLicencingMiddleware`` as a dependency to your
Xcode project by clicking File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency. In the upcoming dialog, please enter
`https://github.com/irlmob/IRLLicencingMiddleware.git` and click Next twice. Finally, select the targets you are planning to use (here `IRLLicencingMiddleware`) and click finish. Now will be able to `import IRLLicencingMiddleware` (as well as all
the other targets you have selected) in your project.

## Usage

- Initialize this struct to set up license middleware in your [Vapor application](https://www.vapor.codes), see ``LicencingMiddleware/init(notice:licence:)``
- Call the ``LicencingMiddleware/setup(in:ignoredPathroot:)`` method to add the middleware to the application.

### Example:

```swift
// configures your application
public func configure(_ app: Application) async throws {
    // Licence
    let publicKey: String =
    """
    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    MM...ABC
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    
    """
    
    // Middleware Injection
    try await LicencingMiddleware(notice:  .init(year: "2023",
                                                 copyright: "Company Inc. Headquarter on the moon",
                                                 copyrighter: "Company Inc.",
                                                 projectName: "Example Project",
                                                 subProjectName: "Frontend App",
                                                 version: "v1.0.0"),
                                   licence: try .fromEnv(with: publicKey))
    .setup(in: app)

    // ... Continue setup ...
   }
```
